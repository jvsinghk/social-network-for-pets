# Social Network for Pets
In this project, I have build a simple social network for pets. You can view a pet’s profile (which contains their name, bio, and friend list) and navigate to other profiles. There is also be a profile directory where you can see all of the profiles.

I’ve already set up three profiles: one for a cat, one for a dog, and one for a Komodo dragon.
